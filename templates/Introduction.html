						<div class="content" id="experiment-article-section-1-content">
							<p>Many scientific applications involve computations involving just not integers but also
								real numbers. In computers we cannot precisely represent all of the real numbers.
								However we can still have a useful and effective representation of them with certain
								loss in precision.</p>
							<p>In this lab we shall understand the basic concepts of Floating Point Numbers and their
								conversion to and from decimal form.</p>
